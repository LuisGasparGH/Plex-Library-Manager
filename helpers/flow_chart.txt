TMDB Manager:
    List Scanner: fetches list items every day, 1 hour after QBT Manager handles torrents (86400 seconds)
    
    Notes regarding List Scanner: as for Movies, the List Scanner is responsible for directly triggering a download attempt, as it is only one file.
    But for TV Shows, the List Scanner only triggers download for the first episode. The rest of the episode downloads are triggered by the File Manager when organizing files.
    The biggest focus of the List Scanner is RSS Feed management, and keeping PLM in sync with the TMDB lists

        > Gets info from "TV" and "Movies" list
        > For every "Movies" item:
            > Send request to DB Manager (through PLM Manager) to search if item exists in database: sends {ID, Category}, receives {Exists}
            (REMINDER: "Movies" item is ONLY in database if the file is already downloaded)
                > If yes: send request to QBT Manager (through PLM Manager) to delete RSS Feed for it: sends {Name, Category}, receives {Deleted}
                (will be ignored if no RSS feed matches)
                > If no: check launch date from item
                    > If launch date not yet passed: send request to QBT Manager (through PLM Manager) to add RSS Feed for it: sends {Name, Category}, receives {Added}
                    (will be ignored if RSS feed already exists)
                    > If launch date already passed: send request to RSS Manager (through PLM Manager) to try add torrent for it: sends {Name, Category}, receives {Added}
                    (will be ignored if torrent for Movie already exists)

                > If yes: get show production info from TMDB, using ID
                    > If production ended at least 1 week ago: send request to QBT Manager (through PLM Manager) to delete RSS Feed for it: sends {Name, Category}, receives {Deleted}
